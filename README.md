# Klak: A Filipino-Oriented Programming Language

**Introduction**

Klak is an object-oriented programming language designed to teach programming concepts to Filipino beginners in a more accessible and engaging manner. 

**Motivation**

Recognizing the scarcity of Filipino-based programming languages and the potential to foster a stronger local IT industry, we developed Klak with the following goals:

* **Accessibility:** Make programming more accessible to Filipino learners by using Tagalog as the primary language.
* **Simplicity:** Provide a beginner-friendly syntax that is easy to learn and understand.
* **Engagement:** Encourage a greater interest in programming among Filipino students.

**Key Features**

* **Tagalog-based Syntax:** Utilizes Tagalog keywords and commands, making learning more intuitive for Filipino speakers.
* **Beginner-Friendly:** Features a simplified syntax and a focus on fundamental programming concepts.

**Current Status**

* **Current stage of development**: Lexer completed, Parser completed

**Future Plans**

* Continue development based on available time and resources.
